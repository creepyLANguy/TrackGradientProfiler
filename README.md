TrackGradientProfiler

TODO - This readme

Make sure you're using x64 and have C:\opencv setup if you wanna just pull the repo and build. 

Should add instructions on how to use this program. (Threshold, ideally b/w bmp. No white edges, but make sure to keep some height at even the lowest point, so you don't end up with a zero value on the geyscale (bad for blender extrude) etc).
